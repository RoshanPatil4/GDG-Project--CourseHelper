## Course Helper App Project

This repository contains the code and resources for the Course Helper App, a full-stack web development project. I have developed the frontend using html, css and js.

## Repo Structure  
### Frontend:
- **CSS/**  
  - `style.css`: I have added all the styling(including landing page and login page) in a single css file.

- **HTML/**  
  - `index.html`: It is the landing-page, displaying the main content and features of the app.  
  - `login.html`: It is the login page with login functionality with input fields and buttons.

- **JS/**  
  - `script.js`: This script allows users to add, edit, and delete courses using a modal form. Courses are displayed as cards, and JavaScript manages the interactions and updates.
